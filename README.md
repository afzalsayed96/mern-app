# MERN stack app using Next.js

The problem statement was to develop a web app using React and MongoDB that can perform user registration and user list action. I took this opportunity to try [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) which is a React Framework with SSR and code splitting by default. It was also my first time working with MongoDB.

## [Demo](https://node-next.herokuapp.com/)
